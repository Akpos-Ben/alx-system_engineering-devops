**Infrastructure Design:**

1. **User Access Request**:
   - A user wants to access the website hosted at www.foobar.com.

2. **Domain Name**:
   - Domain Name: foobar.com
   - DNS Record: www.foobar.com (A record pointing to the load balancer)

3. **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**:
   - Configuration: Round-robin distribution algorithm.
   - Purpose: Distributes incoming HTTP requests evenly across multiple servers.
   - Active-Active Setup: All load balancer instances are active and share the incoming traffic load.

4. **Web Servers (Nginx)**:
   - Two instances for redundancy and scalability.
   - Serve as the entry point for HTTP requests and serve static content.

5. **Application Server**:
   - Executes the application codebase.
   - Processes dynamic requests and communicates with the database.

6. **Application Files**:
   - Codebase stored on the application server.
   - Contains website logic, such as HTML templates, backend code (e.g., Python, Ruby), etc.

7. **Database (MySQL)**:
   - Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster setup.
   - Primary node: Handles write operations.
   - Replica node: Replicates data from the primary node and handles read operations.
   - Application communicates with the primary node for write operations and with replica nodes for read operations.

**Explanation of Specifics:**

- **Additional Elements**:
  - Load Balancer: Added for distributing incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers, enhancing scalability and reliability.

- **Load Balancer Algorithm**:
  - Round-robin: Distributes requests sequentially across the available servers, ensuring each server receives an equal share of the load.

- **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup**:
  - Active-Active: All components (load balancers, servers) are active and handle traffic simultaneously, providing redundancy and scalability.
  - Active-Passive: Involves standby components that only become active when the primary components fail. It offers redundancy but may result in underutilization of resources.

- **Database Primary-Replica Cluster**:
  - Primary Node: Handles write operations and acts as the authoritative source of data.
  - Replica Node: Replicates data from the primary node and serves read requests, enhancing read scalability and providing fault tolerance.

- **Difference between Primary and Replica Nodes**:
  - Primary Node: Handles write operations, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
  - Replica Node: Serves read requests, improving read scalability and providing fault tolerance, but does not accept write operations directly.

**Issues with this Infrastructure:**

1. **Single Points of Failure (SPOF)**:
   - Potential SPOFs include the load balancer, database primary node, and application server. Failure of any of these components could lead to service disruption.

2. **Security Issues**:
   - Lack of firewall: Exposes servers and databases to potential security threats.
   - No HTTPS: Data transmitted between the user's browser and servers is not encrypted, posing a security risk.

3. **No Monitoring**:
   - Without monitoring tools, it's challenging to detect and address performance issues, security breaches, or component failures proactively.
